This repository holds project files with datasets and trained models that look at several machine learning and deep learning techniques including linear regression, classification, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - computer vision, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) - natural language processing, and  reinforcement learning.

The projects utilized the TensorFlow 2 (Python) and Keras APIs.
